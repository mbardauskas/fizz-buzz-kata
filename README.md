# fizz-buzz-kata

Exercise on generalisation and abstraction

## How to start

```
git clone https://github.com/mbardauskas/fizz-buzz-kata
cd fizz-buzz-kata
npm install
npm run watch
```

## Task

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Further steps

There will be a set of new requirements, which will force you to redesign the app. Don't try to assume or jump ahead, embrace one step at a time.
